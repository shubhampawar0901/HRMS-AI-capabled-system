## üìä **Common Business Queries**

### **Employee Information Queries:**
```sql
-- Get employee with department info
SELECT e.*, d.name as department_name 
FROM employees e 
LEFT JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id 
WHERE e.id = ?

-- Get team members under manager
SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, e.position 
FROM employees e 
WHERE e.manager_id = ? AND e.status = 'active'
```

### **Attendance Analysis:**
```sql
-- Monthly attendance summary
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_days,
  SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'present' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as present_days,
  SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'absent' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as absent_days,
  SUM(totalHours) as total_hours
FROM attendance 
WHERE employeeId = ? AND MONTH(date) = ? AND YEAR(date) = ?
```

### **Leave Management:**
```sql
-- Current year leave balance
SELECT lb.*, lt.name as leave_type_name
FROM leave_balances lb
JOIN leave_types lt ON lb.leave_type_id = lt.id
WHERE lb.employee_id = ? AND lb.year = YEAR(CURDATE())
```

## üéØ **LLM Query Generation Guidelines**

### **Security Rules:**
1. **Always filter by employee_id** for personal data queries
2. **Never expose other employees' sensitive data** (salary, personal info)
3. **Use proper JOINs** to get related information
4. **Filter by status = 'active'** for current employees
5. **30-second timeout** for all LLM operations

### **Performance Tips:**
1. **Use indexed columns** for WHERE clauses (employee_id, date, status)
2. **Limit date ranges** for large tables (attendance, payroll)
3. **Use appropriate aggregations** (COUNT, SUM, AVG) for summaries

### **Common Patterns:**
- **Personal Data:** Always WHERE employee_id = ?
- **Date Ranges:** Use BETWEEN for date ranges
- **Status Filters:** Include status checks for active records
- **Joins:** Use LEFT JOIN to include records even if related data is missing
