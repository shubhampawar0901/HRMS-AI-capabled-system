2. LEAVE POLICIES
2.1 ANNUAL LEAVE
2.1.1 ENTITLEMENT AND ELIGIBILITY
Full-time Employees: All permanent full-time employees working 40 hours per week are entitled to 21 working days of annual leave per calendar year. This entitlement is effective from the first day of employment, though leave can only be taken after completing the probationary period.

Part-time Employees: Part-time employees working less than 40 hours per week receive pro-rated annual leave based on their contracted hours. For example:

30 hours per week (75% of full-time): 15.75 days annual leave
20 hours per week (50% of full-time): 10.5 days annual leave
16 hours per week (40% of full-time): 8.4 days annual leave
Contract and Temporary Staff: Fixed-term contract employees with contracts exceeding 6 months are entitled to annual leave on the same basis as permanent employees. Temporary staff with contracts less than 6 months receive statutory minimum leave entitlement only.

New Employee Calculation: For employees joining mid-year, annual leave is calculated as follows:

Joining in Q1 (Jan-Mar): Full 21 days entitlement
Joining in Q2 (Apr-Jun): 16 days entitlement
Joining in Q3 (Jul-Sep): 11 days entitlement
Joining in Q4 (Oct-Dec): 6 days entitlement
2.1.2 ACCRUAL RATES AND CALCULATION
Monthly Accrual: Annual leave accrues at a rate of 1.75 days per completed month of service. Accrual begins from the first day of employment but cannot be taken until after completing 90 days of continuous service.

Daily Accrual Calculation: For precise calculations, leave accrues at 0.0583 days per working day (21 days รท 360 working days per year). This ensures accurate pro-rating for employees with irregular start dates.

Maximum Accrual Limit: Employees cannot accrue more than 30 days of annual leave at any time. Once the 30-day limit is reached, no further leave will accrue until some leave is taken. Employees will receive monthly notifications when approaching the accrual limit.

Minimum Service Requirement: New employees must complete 90 consecutive days of service before taking their first annual leave. During this period, leave continues to accrue but cannot be accessed except in exceptional circumstances with CEO approval.

Accrual During Leave: Annual leave continues to accrue during paid leave periods including annual leave, sick leave, and maternity/paternity leave. Accrual is suspended during unpaid leave periods exceeding 30 days.

2.1.3 CARRY-OVER RULES AND RESTRICTIONS
Annual Carry-Over: A maximum of 5 days of unused annual leave may be carried forward to the following calendar year. This carry-over is automatic and does not require special approval.

Use-It-Or-Lose-It Policy: Carried-over leave must be used by March 31st of the following year. Any unused carried-over leave will be automatically forfeited on April 1st with no compensation.

Exceptional Circumstances: In cases where business requirements prevented an employee from taking leave, the CEO may approve carrying forward up to 10 days, with a deadline of June 30th for usage.

Leave Forfeiture Notifications: Employees will receive warnings at:

November 1st: If more than 16 days remain unused
December 1st: If more than 10 days remain unused
February 1st: If carried-over leave remains unused
March 15th: Final warning before forfeiture

2.1.6 LEAVE ENCASHMENT AND COMPENSATION
Resignation/Termination Encashment: Upon leaving the company, employees will be compensated for all unused annual leave up to the maximum accrual limit of 30 days. Compensation is calculated at the employee's current basic salary rate.

Annual Encashment Option: Once per calendar year, employees may encash up to 10 days of accrued annual leave. This option is available only after completing 2 years of service and maintaining a minimum balance of 5 days.

Encashment Calculation: Leave encashment is calculated as: (Basic Salary รท 30) ร Number of Days. Only basic salary is considered, excluding allowances and bonuses.

Tax Implications: Encashed leave is subject to standard income tax deductions. Employees are advised to consult with the finance team regarding tax implications.

KEY POINT: Annual leave is a valuable benefit designed to ensure employee well-being and work-life balance. Employees are strongly encouraged to take regular breaks and utilize their full leave entitlement throughout the year rather than accumulating large balances.
