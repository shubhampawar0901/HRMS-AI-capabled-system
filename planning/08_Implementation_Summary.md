## 🤖 **AI Features Implementation Strategy**

### **LLM-Based Approach** (As per teacher's guidance):
1. **Attrition Predictor**: Vector embeddings + LLM comparison
2. **Smart Feedback Generator**: Performance data → LLM → Professional comments
3. **Anomaly Detection**: Data analysis → LLM → Anomaly identification
4. **HR Chatbot**: RAG system with policy documents + LLM responses
5. **Smart Reports**: Team/employee data → LLM → Executive summaries
6. **Resume Parser**: PDF → Text extraction → LLM → Structured JSON

### **Technology Stack**:
- **LLM API**: OpenAI GPT-4 or Claude
- **Vector Database**: Pinecone or Chroma for RAG
- **PDF Processing**: pdf-parse for resume extraction
- **Embeddings**: OpenAI embeddings for similarity matching

## 🚀 **Multi-Agent Development Benefits**

### **Backend Services Independence**:
- ✅ **Agent 1** can work on `auth-service` without affecting others
- ✅ **Agent 2** can develop `employee-service` independently
- ✅ **Agent 3** can build `ai-service` with LLM integration
- ✅ **Agent 4** can create `payroll-service` with calculations
- ✅ No merge conflicts or dependencies between agents

### **Frontend Modules Independence**:
- ✅ **Agent 1** develops `auth` module with complete isolation
- ✅ **Agent 2** builds `employees` module independently
- ✅ **Agent 3** creates `ai-features` module with LLM integration
- ✅ **Agent 4** develops `reports` module with analytics
- ✅ Shared components ensure UI consistency

### **Development Workflow**:
```bash
# Agent 1: Auth development
cd backend/services/auth-service && npm test
cd frontend/src/modules/auth && npm run test:auth

# Agent 2: Employee management
cd backend/services/employee-service && npm test
cd frontend/src/modules/employees && npm run test:employees

# Agent 3: AI features
cd backend/services/ai-service && npm test
cd frontend/src/modules/ai-features && npm run test:ai

# No conflicts between agents!
```
