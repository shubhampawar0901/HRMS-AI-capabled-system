Q: 1
🧠 AI-Enhanced HRMS Platform
🚀 Enterprise Clone of: Keka HRMS
📌 Problem Statement
Modern organizations rely on streamlined, centralized systems to manage human resources, payroll, attendance, performance, and employee engagement. This project aims to build a full-featured Human Resource Management System (HRMS) similar to Keka, but with advanced AI-powered capabilities that automate repetitive tasks, offer smart insights, and improve decision-making.

The platform should provide robust modules for employee management, payroll processing, attendance tracking, performance reviews, leave management, and more. Additionally, it should include AI integrations to:

🎯 Core Features
🧑‍💼 Employee Management
Employee onboarding/offboarding workflows
Role-based access control and permission management
Org chart visualization and department mapping
📅 Attendance & Leave Management
Biometric or virtual attendance logging
Calendar-based leave application and approval system
Leave policy configurations and auto accrual tracking
💰 Payroll Management
Salary structure builder (CTC, deductions, allowances)
Payroll run automation and payslip generation
Compliance tracking (PF, ESI, TDS, etc.)
📈 Performance Management
Goals/KRAs/OKRs setting and tracking
360-degree feedback and peer reviews
Performance review cycles and appraisal automation

📊 Reports & Analytics
Standard and custom reports for payroll, attendance, leaves
Export in multiple formats (Excel, PDF, CSV)
Role-specific dashboards (HR, Manager, Employee)


🤖 AI-Powered Add-ons
Attrition Predictor: Predict employees likely to leave using behavioral and performance data
Smart Feedback Generator: Auto-generate performance review comments using AI
Anomaly Detection: Detect anomalies in payroll or attendance data (e.g., sudden overtime spikes)
HR Chatbot: A conversational assistant to help employees with HR-related queries (leave balance, policy info, etc.)
Smart Reports: Natural language summaries of employee performance or team trends
Resume Parser: Extract key candidate details from uploaded resumes during onboarding


🏗️ Technical Expectations
💻 Tech Stack
Frontend: Any modern framework with responsive UI support
Backend: Scalable server-side technology with relational database
Authentication: Token-based
Real-time updates: WebSockets
File Uploads: Cloud storage for supporting documents (e.g., S3)
