## 🔄 **Query Processing Flow**

### **Step-by-Step Security Process**:

1. **Authentication Check** ✅
   - Validate JWT token
   - Extract user role and permissions

2. **Intent Classification** ✅
   - Analyze query to determine intent
   - Check against role-restricted intents

3. **Security Validation** ✅
   - Validate if user can access requested data type
   - Block unauthorized queries immediately

4. **Secure Context Building** ✅
   - Fetch only permitted data based on role
   - Apply data sanitization filters

5. **Gemini AI Processing** ✅
   - Send role-specific prompts to Gemini
   - Include security rules in prompts

6. **Response Filtering** ✅
   - Scan response for sensitive patterns
   - Replace restricted information with placeholders

7. **Audit Logging** ✅
   - Log all interactions for security review
   - Track access attempts and violations

## 🎯 **Expected Query Examples by Role**

### **Admin Queries**:
- "Show me employees with high attrition risk"
- "Generate payroll summary for all departments"
- "What are current HR policy violations?"
- "Show department-wise performance metrics"

### **Manager Queries**:
- "Show my team's attendance this week"
- "Who has pending leave requests in my team?"
- "What's my team's average performance rating?"
- "How do I approve a leave request?"

### **Employee Queries**:
- "What's my current leave balance?"
- "When is my next performance review?"
- "How do I apply for annual leave?"
- "What's the company remote work policy?"

## 🚫 **Security Denial Examples**

### **Employee Trying to Access Restricted Data**:
```
Query: "Show me John's salary information"
Response: "I'm sorry, but I don't have access to that information based on your current permissions. Please contact your HR department for assistance."
```

### **Manager Trying to Access Salary Data**:
```
Query: "What's the salary range for my team?"
Response: "Access to salary information is restricted. Please contact HR for compensation-related inquiries."
```

## 📊 **Database Schema**

### **Conversation Storage**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE chatbot_conversations (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  session_id VARCHAR(255),
  user_message TEXT,
  bot_response TEXT,
  intent VARCHAR(100),
  confidence_score DECIMAL(3,2),
