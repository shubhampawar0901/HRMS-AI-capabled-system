# 🚀 Parallel Development Master Plan - AI-Enhanced HRMS

## 📋 **Overview**

This document provides comprehensive task assignments for **multiple AI agents** working simultaneously in **separate VSCode instances** on the HRMS project. Each agent has **independent, conflict-free tasks** with detailed specifications.

## 🏗️ **Development Architecture**

### **Backend Services** (Independent Development)
```
backend/services/
├── auth-service/           # Agent 1
├── employee-service/       # Agent 2  
├── attendance-service/     # Agent 3
├── leave-service/          # Agent 4
├── payroll-service/        # Agent 5
├── performance-service/    # Agent 6
├── ai-service/            # Agent 7
└── reports-service/       # Agent 8
```

### **Frontend Modules** (Independent Development)
```
frontend/src/modules/
├── auth/                  # Agent 9
├── dashboard/             # Agent 10
├── employees/             # Agent 11
├── attendance/            # Agent 12
├── leave/                 # Agent 13
├── payroll/               # Agent 14
├── performance/           # Agent 15
├── ai-features/           # Agent 16
└── reports/               # Agent 17
```

### **Phase 2: Core Business Services** (Agents 5-8)
- **Agent 5**: Payroll Service
- **Agent 6**: Performance Management Service
- **Agent 7**: AI Features Service
- **Agent 8**: Reports Service

### **Phase 3: Frontend Modules** (Agents 9-17)
- **Agent 9**: Authentication Module
- **Agent 10**: Dashboard Module
- **Agent 11**: Employee Management Module
- **Agent 12**: Attendance Module
- **Agent 13**: Leave Management Module
- **Agent 14**: Payroll Module
- **Agent 15**: Performance Module
- **Agent 16**: AI Features Module
- **Agent 17**: Reports Module

## 📚 **Required Reading for All Agents**

### **Mandatory Documents** (Read Before Starting):
1. `planning/Workflow/backend.md` - Backend development rules
2. `planning/Workflow/frontend.md` - Frontend development rules
3. `planning/Workflow/database.md` - Database guidelines
4. `planning/01_Database_Schema_Design.md` - Complete database schema
5. `planning/04_API_Endpoints_Design.md` - API specifications
6. `planning/AI_Features_Implementation_Logic.md` - AI implementation details

### **Service-Specific Documents**:
- `planning/06_Backend_Architecture_Modular.md` - Backend architecture
- `planning/07_Frontend_Architecture_Modular.md` - Frontend architecture
- `planning/02_UI_Screens_Design.md` - UI specifications
- `planning/03_UI_Flow_Navigation.md` - Navigation flows

---

## 🔧 **Development Environment Setup**

### **Each Agent's VSCode Instance**:
```bash
# Agent working directory structure
HRMS-clone/
├── backend/services/[assigned-service]/     # Agent's backend work
├── frontend/src/modules/[assigned-module]/  # Agent's frontend work
├── planning/                                # Reference documentation
└── tests/                                   # Agent-specific tests
```

### **Git Branch Strategy**:
```bash
# Each agent creates feature branch
git checkout -b feature/[service-name]-implementation
git checkout -b feature/[module-name]-frontend

# Example:
git checkout -b feature/auth-service-implementation
git checkout -b feature/auth-module-frontend
```

## ⚡ **Parallel Development Rules**

### **🚫 What Agents CANNOT Touch**:
- `backend/shared/` folder (managed centrally)
- `backend/config/` folder (managed centrally)
- `backend/app.js` (managed centrally)
- `frontend/src/shared/` folder (managed centrally)
- Other agents' service/module folders
- Database migration files (managed centrally)

### **✅ What Agents CAN Modify**:
- Their assigned service folder completely
- Their assigned frontend module folder completely
- Service-specific test files
- Module-specific test files
- Service-specific documentation

### **🔄 Inter-Agent Communication**:
- **API Contracts**: Defined in planning documents
- **Shared Components**: Use from `frontend/src/shared/`
- **Database Models**: Use from `backend/shared/models/`
- **No Direct Dependencies**: Services communicate via APIs only

## 📞 **Support & Coordination**

### **When Agents Need Help**:
1. **Technical Issues**: Refer to planning documents first
2. **API Questions**: Check `planning/04_API_Endpoints_Design.md`
3. **Database Questions**: Check `planning/01_Database_Schema_Design.md`
4. **UI Questions**: Check `planning/02_UI_Screens_Design.md`
5. **Conflicts**: Report immediately for resolution

### **Progress Reporting**:
- Each agent reports completion status
- User commits completed work personally
- Integration testing happens after individual completion
- Deployment coordination managed centrally

---

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Assign agents to specific services/modules**
2. **Each agent reads mandatory documentation**
3. **Agents create feature branches**
4. **Parallel development begins**
5. **Regular progress check-ins**
6. **Integration testing after completion**
7. **User commits and deploys completed work**

This master plan ensures **conflict-free parallel development** with **clear responsibilities** and **comprehensive coverage** of all HRMS functionality.
