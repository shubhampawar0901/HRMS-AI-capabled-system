# Resume Upload Error Fix

## 🚨 **Problem Identified**

The error you encountered was:
```
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'C:\Programming\HRMS\backend\agent1\HRMS-AI-capabled-system\backend\uploads\resume-1749988022625-892458408.pdf'
```

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

### **Issue 1: Missing uploads Directory**
- The `uploads` folder was **missing** from the backend directory
- Multer was configured to save files to `./uploads` but the directory didn't exist
- When files were uploaded, multer couldn't save them, causing the ENOENT error

### **Issue 2: Incomplete File Processing**
- The `extractTextFromFile` method was returning placeholder text instead of actually reading files
- PDF parsing was not implemented despite `pdf-parse` being installed

### **Issue 3: No File Cleanup**
- Uploaded files were not being cleaned up after processing
- This would eventually fill up the uploads directory

## ✅ **Solutions Implemented**

### **1. Created uploads Directory**
```bash
mkdir uploads
```
- Created the missing `uploads` directory in `backend/`
- Added `.gitkeep` file to ensure directory is tracked in git

### **2. Fixed File Text Extraction**
- **Added proper imports**: `fs.promises` and `pdf-parse`
- **Implemented real PDF parsing**: Using `pdf-parse` library to extract text from PDF files
- **Added error handling**: Graceful fallback if file reading fails
- **Added file type detection**: Different handling for PDF vs Word documents

### **3. Added File Cleanup**
- **Automatic cleanup**: Files are deleted after processing (success or failure)
- **Prevents disk space issues**: Uploads directory won't fill up over time
- **Error handling**: Cleanup continues even if main processing fails

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### **Multer Configuration (Already Correct)**
```javascript
const storage = multer.diskStorage({
  destination: (req, file, cb) => {
    cb(null, process.env.UPLOAD_PATH || 'uploads/'); // ✅ Points to uploads/
  },
  filename: (req, file, cb) => {
    const uniqueSuffix = Date.now() + '-' + Math.round(Math.random() * 1E9);
    cb(null, file.fieldname + '-' + uniqueSuffix + path.extname(file.originalname));
  }
});
```

### **Environment Variable (Already Set)**
```env
UPLOAD_PATH=./uploads
```

### **Updated extractTextFromFile Method**
```javascript
async extractTextFromFile(file) {
  try {
    console.log('Extracting text from file:', file.originalname, 'at path:', file.path);
    
    // Check if file exists and read it
    const fileBuffer = await fs.readFile(file.path);
    
    // Extract text based on file type
    if (file.mimetype === 'application/pdf') {
      const pdfData = await pdfParse(fileBuffer);
      console.log('PDF text extracted, length:', pdfData.text.length);
      return pdfData.text;
    } else if (file.mimetype === 'application/msword' || 
               file.mimetype === 'application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document') {
      // Word document fallback
      return `Word document content from ${file.originalname}. Please convert to PDF for better text extraction.`;
    } else {
      return `Unsupported file type: ${file.mimetype}. Please upload a PDF file for best results.`;
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Text extraction error:', error);
    return `Error extracting text from ${file.originalname}: ${error.message}. Please try uploading a different file.`;
  }
}
```

### **Added File Cleanup**
```javascript
// Clean up uploaded file after processing
try {
  await fs.unlink(file.path);
  console.log('Cleaned up uploaded file:', file.path);
} catch (cleanupError) {
  console.warn('Failed to cleanup uploaded file:', cleanupError.message);
}
```

## 🧪 **Testing the Fix**

### **1. Verify uploads Directory**
```bash
ls -la backend/uploads/
# Should show .gitkeep file
```

### **2. Test File Upload**
1. Upload a PDF resume through the frontend
2. Check console logs for:
   - "Extracting text from file: [filename] at path: [path]"
   - "PDF text extracted, length: [number]"
   - "Cleaned up uploaded file: [path]"

### **3. Expected Behavior Now**
1. ✅ File uploads successfully to `uploads/` directory
2. ✅ PDF text is extracted using `pdf-parse`
3. ✅ AI processes the actual resume content
4. ✅ Form fields are populated with real extracted data
5. ✅ File is automatically cleaned up after processing

## 📁 **File Structure After Fix**

```
backend/
├── uploads/                    # ✅ NOW EXISTS
│   └── .gitkeep               # ✅ Ensures directory is tracked
├── services/
│   └── AIService.js           # ✅ Updated with real PDF parsing
├── routes/
│   └── aiRoutes.js           # ✅ Already configured correctly
└── .env                      # ✅ UPLOAD_PATH already set
```

## 🚀 **What Should Work Now**

1. **File Upload**: Files are saved to `uploads/` directory
2. **PDF Processing**: Real text extraction from PDF files
3. **AI Parsing**: Gemini processes actual resume content
4. **Form Population**: Fields populated with extracted data
5. **File Cleanup**: No leftover files in uploads directory

## 🔍 **Debugging Tips**

### **Check Console Logs**
Look for these log messages:
- `"Extracting text from file: [filename] at path: [path]"`
- `"PDF text extracted, length: [number]"`
- `"Cleaned up uploaded file: [path]"`

### **Verify File Permissions**
Ensure the uploads directory has write permissions:
```bash
chmod 755 backend/uploads/
```

### **Check File Size**
Ensure uploaded files are under 5MB limit (configured in multer)

## 📋 **Summary**

The issue was caused by a **missing uploads directory**. The fix involved:

1. ✅ **Created uploads directory** with `.gitkeep`
2. ✅ **Implemented real PDF text extraction** using `pdf-parse`
3. ✅ **Added automatic file cleanup** to prevent disk space issues
4. ✅ **Enhanced error handling** for better debugging

The resume upload and AI parsing should now work correctly! 🎉
