# Payroll API Fix Testing

## Issues Fixed:
1. **Frontend**: `user.employeeId` was undefined - Fixed by storing employee data in AuthContext
2. **Backend**: Employee payslips endpoint validation - Fixed validation logic

## Test Steps:

### 1. Test Login and User Data
- Login as an employee user
- Check browser localStorage for user object
- Verify `employeeId` is now present in user object

### 2. Test Employee Payslips API
- Navigate to payroll page as employee
- Check browser network tab for API calls
- Verify `/api/payroll/payslips` endpoint works without undefined employeeId

### 3. Test Salary Structure API  
- Check `/api/payroll/salary-structure/{employeeId}` endpoint
- Verify employeeId is properly passed from frontend

## Expected Results:
- ✅ No more "undefined" in API URLs
- ✅ Employee payslips load successfully
- ✅ Salary structure loads successfully
- ✅ No validation errors in backend

## Test URLs:
- Employee Payslips: `GET /api/payroll/payslips`
- Salary Structure: `GET /api/payroll/salary-structure/{employeeId}`

## Browser Testing:
1. Open http://localhost:3000/payroll
2. Login as employee
3. Check Network tab for API calls
4. Verify no 400/500 errors
